Project Recipes

This current project from TOP (The Odin Project) will now be put into practice the knowledge of HTML and use this knowledge to build my very own website (odin-recipes). 

The skills I have acquired so far in this foundation course will help demonstrate my understanding of the following tools I will use in this project: command line, Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
